ID3Lib History

The following is a history of id3lib up to version 3.05a.  Please see the
NEWS file for changes since then.

23 Nov 1998     3.05a   - Released 3.05a in which the only change was the 
                          inclusion of a C header file for using the DLL
                          (how forgetful I am!).

22 Nov 1998     3.05    - Released 3.05 and the DLL.

 8 Nov 1998     3.05    - Finished the first revision of the DLL.  Interesting
                          stuff.  Contains both C++ class and C functions (the
                          C++ classes that are exported to the DLL are Tag,
                          Frame, Field and Error).
                        - Took out the SetVersion function from the ID3_Tag 
                          class.  This is because I no longer wish ID3Lib to be
                          able to create the old ID3v2-2.0 tags.  ID3Lib will
                          always create the latest version tags it is capable
                          of creating.

 1 Nov 1998     3.05    - Removed the encryption and grouping stuff.  I have a
                          lot to do before I finish that section and I might 
                          end up implementing it differently, so I thought it
                          best to remove it before people started using it 
                          (no-one should since it wasn't fully functional
                          anyway).

13 Oct 1998     3.05    - Work has begun on the Windows DLL.

 9 Oct 1998     3.04    - Added the text list handling functions from 2.16, but
                          they are slightly different under 3.xx.
                        - Also added a Size() function for fields which
                          applications can use to allocate buffers and so on.
                        - Work has progressed on the encryption and grouping
                          side of things, but nothing usable by an application
                          just yet.

 5 Oct 1998     3.04    - Changed the ID3_AddHandler() function to include a
                          parameter which specifies the factor by which the 
                          size of the frame may increase as a result of
                          encryption or encoding.  This is used for buffer and
                          size estimates.

 3 Oct 1998     3.03a   - Fixed a small Unicode BOM bug.

 2 Oct 1998     3.03    - Added very minimal and not-totally-functional support
                          for the automatic handling of encryption and
                          grouping.
                        - Added a function to ID3_Tag which makes attaching
                          arrays of ID3_Frame objects easy.

 1 Oct 1998     3.03    - Yesterday, ID3v2-3.0 became an informal standard.  
                          Due to this, ID3Lib now does not create ID3v2-3.0
                          tags with the EXPERIMENTAL bit set.

30 Sep 1998     3.02    - Expanded the error handling class to include
                          functions which return the ID3Lib source file and
                          line number of the exception. This is useful for
                          debugging and generating bug reports (hint, hint).

28 Sep 1998     3.02    - Added the grouping registration and encryption
                          registration frames.  Also added support for parsing
                          and rendering frames with the grouping and encryption
                          symbols, although currently this data is ignored.  I
                          plan to implement call backs to handle the encryption
                          and decryption of data.  Also, there is currently no
                          checking at render-time that all frames which have
                          these symbols also have a corresponding rego frame.

26 Sep 1998     3.02    - Changed the 'tag changed' stuff so that calls to
                          ID3_Tag::SetVersion(), ID3_Tag::SetCompression() etc
                          now constitute a change in the tag.  This is because
                          of the relaxed restrictions on the calls to these
                          functions before rendering/updating.  - Fixed a bug
                          in the ID3_Tag::Link() command.

25 Sep 1998     3.01    - Added the ID3_Tag::RemoveFrame() function.
                        - Added the ID3_Tag::SetExtendedHeader() function, even
                          though this setting is currently ignored.
                        - Added luint return type to the Field::Get() functions
                          for ASCII and Unicode strings.  These functions now
                          return how many characters (not bytes necessarily) of
                          the supplied buffer were used, not including the
                          NULL-termination.
                        - Added the 'unique file identifier' frame which I
                          omitted from 3.00 but was present in 2.xx.
                        - Added code that allows ID3Lib and applications to
                          track whether a tag has been altered since the last
                          parse or render.
                        - Slightly altered the padding strategy when a tag 
                          shrinks in size.
                        - No more requirements on when ID3_Tag::SetVersion()
                          etc must be called, except that they should be called
                          prior to an update or render if you plan to use
                          different settings than the defaults.

21 Sep 1998     3.00    - Released 3.00

15 Sep 1998     3.00    - Added support for parsing and converting ID3v1/1.1
                          and Lyrics3 v2.0 tags and CDM frames from 2.01
                          experimental tags.  Also parses Unicode now.

 9 Sep 1998     3.00    - Work almost done on 3.00.  A little bit to fix up in
                          the parsing department (doesn't parse Unicode yet, or
                          CDMs from the old 2.01 draft).  Then just add
                          validity checking and support for most of the frames.

 2 Sep 1998     2.16    - Small Unicode string parsing bug fixed.

25 Aug 1998     2.15    - Small bug fixes in the tag parsing routines.
                        - Completely removed support for creating extended
                          headers, and ID3Lib will now ignore tags which have
                          the EXTENDEDHEADER bit set (as under 2.00, this bit
                          isn't defined).

24 Aug 1998     2.14    - Small bug fixes in the example file 'convert.cpp'.
                        - ID3Lib now sets the EXPERIMENTAL bit in the tag
                          header.

13 Aug 1998     2.13    - As of 2.13, ID3Lib now comes in two flavours.  The
                          first is the normal distribution as we have come to
                          know and love.  The second is a machine-specific
                          archive which contains the static link libraries.
                          Currently, you can get Win32 link libraries.

12 Aug 1998     2.12    - As of 2.12, the ID3Lib distribution will contain
                          precompiled static libraries for Visual C++ and
                          eventually for Linux i386.  The MSVC static libs are
                          be compiled for the multi-threaded run-time library
                          and there will be one for debugging and one normal
                          one for release-quality applications.

                        - Fixed a small exclusion in the 'id3_support.h' file.
                          It now contains a #include for the 'wchar.h' header
                          file.  The absence of this line resulted in some
                          applications producing compilation errors if they
                          didn't already include it or 'stdio.h'.

11 Aug 1998     2.12    - I created a small problem in 2.11 where the name of
                          the URL field in the 'ID3FID_WWWUSER' frame ('WXX')
                          was changed from ID3FN_URL to ID3FN_TEXT.  This has
                          been fixed (is back to ID3FN_URL).
                        - When reading a binary tag, previous versions of
                          ID3Lib ignored the fact that some of the frames in
                          the tag may have been compressed, so when writing the
                          tag back out, those old frames were written without
                          compression.  This is fixed so that all old frames
                          are written back out as they were read in, unless of
                          course you explicitly change the compression status
                          before rendering the new tag.
                        - Added the ID3C_SetSongSize and ID3C_GetSongSize
                          commands to the ID3_Tag class.  These allow you to
                          tell ID3Lib how big (in bytes) the song file is to
                          which you intend attaching the tag.  ID3Lib can then
                          work out how much padding the tag requires to
                          correctly make the entire resulting file fill an even
                          multiple of 2Kb.
                        - If the tag we are manipulating was read in as a
                          binary tag before we started playing with it, then
                          ID3Lib will record the size of tag before we started
                          fooling around with it.  This way, the padding system
                          can pad the new tag out to the old size if the new
                          tag will still fit inside the old one.  This makes
                          file manipulation much easier when writing tags to
                          existing song files.  If it won't fit, then the new
                          tag will receive padding as per the 2K cluster
                          method.  All this talk of padding only applies if the
                          tag's padding property is set to ID3PD_AUTOMATIC,
                          which it is by default.

10 Aug 1998     2.11    - Replaced ID3C_SetID and GetID with proper field
                          names, and the same with ID3C_SetComp and GetComp.
                          This requires a change in source code for the
                          application.  Without quotes, do a search and
                          replace...

                     "ID3C_SetID,"   replace with "ID3C_Set, ID3FN_ID,"
                     "ID3C_GetID,"   replace with "ID3C_Get, ID3FN_ID,"
                     "ID3C_SetComp," replace with "ID3C_Set, ID3FN_COMPRESSED,"
                     "ID3C_GetComp," replace with "ID3C_Get, ID3FN_COMPRESSED,"

                        - Thanks to a suggestion by Ilana Rudnik, I added a
                          generic frame type called 'ID3FID_UNSUPPORTED' which
                          is only to be used by applications as a
                          'place-holder' in lists and arrays while waiting for
                          ID3Lib to support all the frames.

 6 Aug 1998     2.11    - Created the ID3C_Locate and ID3C_GetNumFrames
                          commands.
                        - Made the documentation an HTML file instead of boring
                          text.

 5 Aug 1998     2.11    - Thanks to Eng-Keong Lee, I have located and fixed a
                          bug which most-of-the-time caused a crash when
                          performing an ID3C_SetID on a frame for the first
                          time.

 3 Aug 1998     2.10    - Fixed a few things to make ID3Lib compile completely
                          cleanly under Linux - thanks to Carlos Puchol for
                          finding the remaining hassles.
                        - Added two commands to adjust the unsync facility -
                          ID3C_SetUnsync and ID3C_GetUnsync.  The default is
                          ID3SY_AUTOMATIC.
                        - Add support for the 2.01 extended tag header.  By
                          default, ID3Lib will NOT write an extended header to
                          tags it creates.  This can be adjusted by the
                          ID3C_SetExtHeader command.
                        - Changed the directory structure so that the required
                          zlib source is now in the same directory as the
                          ID3Lib source.

 2 Aug 1998     2.10    - Fixed a small memory leak which occurred when
                          clearing a tag of frames which were read in from an
                          external binary tag.
                        - Added a 'bugreport.txt' file to the documentation to
                          improve effectiveness of bug reporting.

 1 Aug 1998     2.10    - Adding support for tag padding.  This results in two
                          new commands which operate on ID3_Tag objects:
                          ID3C_SetPadding and ID3C_GetPadding.

 1 Aug 1998     2.09    - Fixed some bugs in the ID3C_ToFile and ID3C_FromFile
                          commands.
                        - Fixed a bug which prevented empty strings which were
                          supposed to be NULL-terminated from doing so.

31 Jul 1998     2.09    - Changed the functionality of the error handling
                          mechanism.  The function interface to the error
                          handler has changed - see the example source file
                          'main.cpp' for details.
                        - Improved frame verification somewhat.

28 July 1998    2.08    - Added ID3C_ToFile command to binary fields.
                        - Changed the format of the ID3C_Size command when
                          applied to frames.  There is now a required second
                          parameter which specifies which field you require the
                          size of.  If you request ID3FN_ALL, you will get the
                          size of the frame itself.
                        - The above change for ID3C_Size now also applies to
                          the ID3C_Clear command (again, only when applied to
                          frames).
                        - Enhanced the ID3C_Find command so as to allow
                          searches based on the ID3FN_LANGUAGE field and the
                          ID3FN_DESCRIPTION field.

27 July 1998    2.07    - Fixed a bug which had the WXX and TXX frames
                          including a language field which they shouldn't.
                        - Fixed a bug in the string's ID3C_Get command which
                          wrongly interpreted the presence of a '/' symbol in 
                          the string as meaning that the string was a textlist.

21 July 1998    2.06    - Added support for frame compression via zlib.  This 
                          means that all frames have an extra attribute which
                          specifies whether the frame should be compressed.
                        - Changed some typedefs and macro names so as not to
                          clash with some of Windows' pre-defined
                          datatypes/names.  Thanks to Chuck Zenkus for finding
                          this.

14 July 1998    2.05    - Finished up Unicode support.  All internal string
                          handling is done with Unicode strings.  Strings are
                          converted as needed during rendering of the tag.

 6 July 1998    2.05    - BINARY fields now support an 'ID3C_FromFile' command
                          which fills the field with data from the specified
                          file.  The file is read and the contents placed in
                          the field immediately on the field encountering this
                          command.

 2 July 1998    2.04    - Improved support for frame validation.
                        - Repaired a cool bug in the error handling which
                          prevented an application from finding further
                          information about the error.  This fix resulted in a
                          new format for the application error handler
                          function.

                2.03    - Added support for the ID3C_Add, ID3C_Remove,
                          ID3C_GetElement, ID3C_GetNumElements commands in the
                          STRING field type.  This allows easy use of the text
                          lists as used in the 'TP1' frame.

                        - Improved error handling once more.
                        - Added support for the ID3C_Increment command in the
                          INT field type.
                        - Added support for the CNT, POP, GEO, TCO, TCR and UFI
                          frames.
                        - Added preliminary validation checking for frames to
                          ensure they meet the ID3v2 standard requirements.
                          Not fully implemented.

                2.02    - Adjusted the '::Do()' function slightly - you can now
                          chain commands together.  The last parameter to this
                          call must now always be 'ID3C_DONE'.
                
 1 July 1998    2.01    - Added the 'ID3_IsTagHeader()' function and an
                          appropriately adjusted ID3C_Parse command.

30 June 1998    2.00    - First preliminary release of ID3Lib v2.00.  Supports
                          lots of frames (even PIC).  Lots of work still
                          needed.

25 June 1998    2.00    - Abandoned the v1.xx framework in favour of a more
                          versatile and expandable one.  This required a major
                          re-write of most of the internals of the library as
                          well as changes to any applications using the
                          previous framework.  The new framework is part of all
                          ID3Libs which are 2.xx.

23 June 1998    1.01    - Released v1.01 which added support for four new
                          frames.  TXX, WXX, COM, ULT

21 June 1998    1.00    - Initial Release (v1.0)
