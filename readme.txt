Welcome to eMule, a filesharing client based on the eDonkey2000(C) network.


Visit us at
 http://www.emule-project.net
and
 http://sourceforge.net/projects/emule
or
 the IRC chatroom, #emule on irc.emule-project.net



Please remember that this is an early version, not all features are 
implemented yet, and not everything might work as expected.

Visit our forum for bugreports, feature requests, development or general 
dicussion.


If you have questions or serious problems, please read the FAQ first :) It can 
be found at www.emule-project.net. A small collection of questions is also 
discussed later in this document.


If you didn't find an answer, SEARCH the forum for a topic related to your 
problem, DO NOT open a new topic at once, most likely someone else had the 
same problem before.

The official Forum is also at http://www.emule-project.net Please use only 
English there, except for the language-specific sections. (PLEASE do not 
report bugs that are already posted by someone else, and keep the "Bug 
Reports", "Feature Requests" and "Development" sections clean and shiny)


Would you like to donate to the eMule project? A PayPal link can be found on 
the portal page (www.emule-project.net) Thanks ;)




INSTALLATION:
-------------

-Unzip eMule to a directory of your choice, or start the installer if you 
 downloaded the .exe installer version.
 
-You can move your "Temp" and "Incoming" folders from eDonkey (or a previous 
 version of eMule) to the new directory now, in order to continue your partial 
 downloads. If you don't want to move your folders, you can set the "temp" and 
 "incoming" path in the eMule preferences and restart it to get the same 
 result.

-Updating from an earlier version of eMule: The best way to do this is simply 
 to download the .zip file (not the installer), and unzip the new emule.exe to 
 your old emule directory, overwriting the previous one.



CONFIGURATION:
--------------

-Go to the "Preferences" tab

-Enter a nice nickname ;)

-Enter the "Download Capacity" and "Upload Capacity" according to your 
 internet connection. All values in eMule are kiloBytes (KB), your Internet 
 Service Provider's (ISP) numbers are most likely kiloBits (kB). 8 Bits make up 
 1 Byte, so when your Internet Connection is 768kB Downstrean and 128kB 
 Upstrean (like German Telekom DSL), your correct values are:

 Downstrean: 768kB / 8 = 96KB, you enter 96 as "Download Capacity"
 Upstream: 128kB / 8 = 16 KB, you enter 16 as "Upload Capacity"

 The "capacity" values are used for the statistics display only. Nevertheless, 
 you need to know them to determine the following down/upload limits:


-Enter "Download Limit" and "Upload Limit"  (IMPORTANT!)
 
 Download Limit: leave this at 0 (should eMule become too fast and you are 
 unable to surf the Internet or whatever, reduce it to 80-90% of "Download 
 Capacity")
 
 Upload Limit: set this to ~80% of your "Upload Capacity" (so when your Upload 
 Capacity is 16, set Upload Limit to 12 or 13)

 Setting Upload Limit to a value < 10 will automatically reduce your Download 
 Limit, so upload as fast as you can.


NOTE: 56k Modem users: eMule only accepts integral values for these settings 
at the moment, you can't enter 2.6 or whatever your sweet-spot setting is, 
yet. Sorry :) Maybe later..


-"Maximum Connections": depends on your operating system. As a general rule...

  -Windows 98/ME (and 56k Modem/ISDN) users enter 50 here
  -Windows 2000/XP users should set this according to their 
   Internet Connection. 250 is a good value for 128k upstream connection, 
   for example. DO NOT set this too high. It will kill your upload and with 
   that, your download.

-"Maximum Sources per File": decide for yourself how many you want :) when you 
 set this too high, your computer might slow down drastically or even crash. 
 500-1000 are good values for people with DSL/cable connection.

-Choose the directories you want to share with other users. DO NOT SHARE YOUR 
 COMPLETE HARDDISK! Put the stuff you want to share in a seperate Folder. If 
 you share more than ~200 files, you should reconsider that...

-The other options are pretty self-explaining. If you dunno what it does, 
don't touch it.



FAQ: (for more, see http://www.emule-project.net/faq/ )
----

--"Will I lose my credits when switching to a new version of eMule?"

 Not when move your old preferences.dat (your user ID) and clients.met (other 
 people's credits) files to the directory you installed the new version in. 
 The best way to update is just to replace your old emule.exe with the new one 
 from the .zip download.



--"Why is eMule so slow? My brother/friend/whatever is downloading at 100K constantly"

 When you did setup eMule properly, it's all about the availibility of the 
 files you are downloading, a bit of luck and a lot of patience ;)



--"Where can I get a new serverlist?"

 There are several lists availible. Some that I know of are:
 -http://www.thedonkeynetwork.com
 -http://ed2k.2x4u.de
 Note that those sites are not related to the eMule project, we are not 
 responsible for their content.



--"What is the adresses.dat file for?"

 You can enter a serverlist URL in that file. eMule will then get the 
 serverlist from that URL at startup (when the option "Auto-update serverlist 
 at startup" is activated)



--"What is the staticservers.dat file good for?"

 You can enter your favorite servers here to have them permanently in your 
 serverlist with high priority. You can enter the static IP of the server, or 
 an adress like goodserver.dyndns.net. You can also add static servers to this 
 file via the server tab in eMule (right-click -> add to static serverlist)


--"Why do I always have a low ID (means: firewalled) ??? What can I do against that?"

 Look here: http://www.emule-project.net/faq/ports.htm



--"How do I know whether my ID is high or low?"

 Look at the arrow in the bottom right corner, next to the server name you are 
 connected to. When it's green, your ID is high. When it's orange, your ID is 
 low.
 


--"What does high and low ID mean anyway?"

 When your ID is high (green arrow), everything is fine :) When it's low 
 (orange arrow), you are behind a firewall or router, and other clients can't 
 connect to you directly (which is a bad thing). Plz read the FAQ or search 
 the forums on how to configure your firewall/router for eMule.

 NOTE: you can also get a low ID when the server you connected to is too busy 
 to answer properly, or simply badly configured. When you are sure your 
 settings are ok and you SHOULD have a high ID, connect to antoher server.



--"What is the difference between up/down CAPACITY and LIMIT?"

 The CAPACITY is used only by the statistcs tab to determine the vertical 
 limits of the diagram. The LIMITS set the actual network traffic limits (see 
 configuration notes).



--"I'd like to search for specific file types, what filter stands for which files?"

 File Type	Extensions found
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Audio		.mp3 .mp2 .mpc .wav .ogg .aac .mp4 .ape .au .wma .flac
 Video		.avi .mpg .mpeg .ram .rm .vob .divx .mov .ogm .vivo
 Program	.exe .com
 Archive	.zip .rar .ace
 CD-Image	.bin .cue .iso .nrg .ccd .sub .img .bwt .bwi .bwa .bws .mdf .mds
 Picture	.jpg .jpeg .bmp .gif .tif .png



--"What are all those fancy colors in the download progress bar about?"

 Each download in the the Transfer tab has a coloured bar to show current file 
 availability and progress.

 -Black shows the parts of the file you already have
 -Red indicates a part missing in all known sources
 -Different shades of blue represent the availability of this part in the
  sources. The darker the blue is the higher the availability
 -Yellow denotes a part being downloaded
 -The green bar on top shows the total download progress of this file

 If you expand the download you see its sources with the corresponding bar. 
 Here the colours have a slightly different meaning:

 -Black shows parts you are still missing
 -Silver stands for parts this source is also missing
 -Green indicates parts you already have
 -Yellow denotes a part being uploaded to you

 Learning how the progress bar works will greatly help your understanding of 
 the eDonkey2000 network.



--"What do the "QR: xxxx" numbers mean that I see when I look at my sources?"

 QR stands for "Queue Rank" and it is your current position in this source's 
 queue.

 Obviously, a lower value is better :) If the source is an eMule client and 
 there is no QR number, it's likely that it's queue is full and cannot accept 
 more clients.




COMPILING THE SOURCECODE:
-------------------------

The sourcecode of eMule is availible as seperate download at:
 http://sourceforge.net/projects/emule
You need Microsoft(C) Visual C++ .NET 2002 to compile eMule.

-Unzip the sources (with subdirs) into a new folder

Since eMule v0.29b the separate download and compilation of additional 
libraries is required. These libs are 3rd party and therefore - as usual - not 
within our distribution. You need the following libs:

1. Crypto++ v5.1
	http://www.eskimo.com/~weidai/cryptlib.html

2. zlib v1.2.1
	http://www.gzip.org/zlib/

3. id3lib v3.8.3
	http://sourceforge.net/projects/id3lib/

4. (for MobileMule only!)
	DirectX SDK
	pnglib: http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html

5. ResizableLib 1.3
   http://sourceforge.net/projects/resizablelib/	

Download and save their sourcecode one level above the eMule source code 
folder and compile them (check the eMule-project file to learn about the 
required foldernames, or adapt them to your needs!).


-Open the emule.sln Visual Studio Solution

-If you get an error message like "wrong version of Visual C++", you have to 
open emule.sln and emule.vcroj with an editor and change some values:

 emule.sln: "...Format Version 8.00" to 7.00 if you use Microsoft(C) Visual C++ .NET 2002
 emule.vcproj: Version="7.10"  to 7.00 if you use Microsoft(C) Visual C++ .NET 2002
 
-Select "release" or "debug" build in the solution configuration manager
-Build the solution. That's it :)
-If the compile was successful, the emule.exe is either in the \Debug or 
 \Release directory
-When you build a debug dump version, you need the latest dbghelp.dll from
 Microsoft to run the app
 
-IMPORTANT:

 If you make modifications to eMule and you distribute the compiled version of 
 your build, be sure to obey the GPL license. You have to include the 
 sourcecode, or make it availible for download together with the binary 
 version.
