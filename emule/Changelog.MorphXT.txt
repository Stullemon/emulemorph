HOS
- best suited for alone sharer starting to spread a file and wanted to upload all the file first.
- becarefull other couldn't see commplete file in some case. And might abort it.
- might be used, if you planed a share and other know it.

NOTE-1: For win2k user you can have 256 colors systray display by patching your explorer.exe ;)
NOTE-2: About Import Parts
General idea from xmrb's CKnownFile::ImportParts()
Unlike xmrb's version which scans entire file designated for import and then tries
to match each PARTSIZE bytes with all parts of partfile, my version assumes that
in file you're importing all parts stay on same place as they should be in partfile
(for example you're importing damaged version of file to recover some parts from ED2K)
That way it works much faster and almost always it is what expected from this function.

NOTE: About WebCache from the official thread
Quick Start:

You need to configure eMule so it uses your ISPs' proxy server, go to Preferences->Webcache and hit the autodetect button (you will need to connect to a server first). If autodetection fails, you will need to enter your proxys' address and port manually. If you don't know your proxys' address, you can try typing your ISPs' name and the word 'proxy' in google and see if that gets you anything. If this too doesn't work, you'll have to call your ISPs' customer support and ask them.

For cached download to occur you must have another client using your proxy and downloading the same file as you are. There's usualy a test file for new webcache releases, the current one is ed2k://|file|webcachemule.1.1.beta.testfile|1078989657|E9057ADC38054AFA24816E86BB08D270|/ but this post may become outdated, so look through the posts refering to the latest version.

When downloading through a proxy you should see a 'Transferring Via Proxy' in your status column, this means that you are downloading from another client via your proxy server. If you see a client called 'HTTP Proxy @ xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx' with a strange icon on your download list, that means you are downloading a cached block from your proxy server.
