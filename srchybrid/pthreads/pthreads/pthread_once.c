	/*
	 * ------------------------------------------------------
	 * DOCPUBLIC
	 *      If any thread in a process  with  a  once_control  parameter
	 *      makes  a  call to pthread_once(), the first call will summon
	 *      the init_routine(), but  subsequent  calls  will  not. The
	 *      once_control  parameter  determines  whether  the associated
	 *      initialization routine has been called.  The  init_routine()
	 *      is complete upon return of pthread_once().
	 *      This function guarantees that one and only one thread
	 *      executes the initialization routine, init_routine when
	 *      access is controlled by the pthread_once_t control
	 *      key.
	 *
	 * PARAMETERS
	 *      once_control
	 *              pointer to an instance of pthread_once_t
	 *
	 *      init_routine
	 *              pointer to an initialization routine
	 *
	 *
	 * DESCRIPTION
	 *      See above.
	 *
	 * RESULTS
	 *              0               success,
	 *              EINVAL          once_control or init_routine is NULL

   * The race condition involving once_control->done is harmless.
   * The problem experienced in MPU environments with multibyte variables
   * is also not a problem because the value (initially zero i.e. PTW32_FALSE)
   * is only ever tested for non-zero. In the event of a race occuring, the
   * worst result is that up to N-1 threads (N = number of CPUs) may enter the
   * while loop and yield their run state unnecessarily, and this can only
   * ever occur at most once.
   *
   * The alternatives are to use a condition variable (overkill?), or
   * InterlockedCompareExchange() to test/set once_control->done.
