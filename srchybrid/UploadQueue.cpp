/**
* Compares two clients, considering requested file and score (waitingtime, credits, requested file prio), and decides if the right
* client is better than the left clien. If so, it returns true.
*
* Clients are ranked in the following classes:
*    1: Friends (friends are internally ranked by which file they want; if it is powershared; upload priority of file)
*    x: Clients that need to be PayBackFirst
*    2: Clients that wants powershared files of prio release
*    3: Clients that wants powershared files of prio high
*    4: Clients that wants powershared files of prio normal
*    5: Clients that wants powershared files of prio low
*    6: Clients that wants powershared files of prio lowest
*    7: Other clients
*
* Clients are then ranked inside their classes by their credits and waiting time (== score).
*
* Another description of the above ranking:
*
* First sortorder is if the client is a friend with a friend slot. Any client that is a friend with a friend slot,
* is ranked higher than any client that does not have a friend slot.
*
* Second sortorder is if the requested file if a powershared file. All clients wanting powershared files are ranked higher
* than any client wanting a not powershared filed.
*
* If the file is powershared, then second sortorder is file priority. For instance. Any client wanting a powershared file with
* upload priority high, is ranked higher than any client wanting a powershared file with upload file priority normal.
*
* If both clients wants powershared files, and of the same upload priority, then the score is used to decide which client is better.
* The score, as usual, weighs in the client's waiting time, credits, and requested file's upload priority.
*
* If both clients wants files that are not powershared, then scores are used to compare the clients, as in official eMule.
*
* @param leftClient a pointer to the left client
*
* @param leftScore the precalculated score for leftClient, which is calculated with leftClient->GetSCore()
*
* @param rightClient a pointer to the right client
*
* @param rightScore the precalculated score for rightClient, which is calculated with rightClient->GetSCore()
*
* @return true if right client is better, false if clients are equal. False if left client is better.

 * Since low ID clients are only put in an upload slot when they call us, it means they will
 * have to wait about 10-30 minutes longer to be put in an upload slot than a high id client.
 * In that time, the low ID client could possibly have gone from being a trickle slot, into
 * being a fully activated slot. At the time when the low ID client would have been put into an
 * upload slot, if it had been a high id slot, a boolean flag is set to true (AddNextConnect = true).
 *
 * A client that has AddNextConnect set when it calls back, will immiediately be given an upload slot.
 * When it is added to the upload list with this method, it will also get the time when it entered the
 * queue taken into consideration. It will be added so that it is before all clients (within in its class) 
 * that entered queue later than it. This way it will be able to possibly skip being a trickle slot,
 * since it has already been forced to wait extra time to be put in a upload slot. This makes the
 * low ID clients have almost exactly the same bandwidth from us (proportionally to the number of low ID
 * clients compared to the number of high ID clients) as high ID clients. This is a definitely a further
 * improvement of VQB's excellent low ID handling.
