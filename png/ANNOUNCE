  Added png_sizeof() and png_convert_size() functions.
  Added PNG_SIZE_MAX (maximum value of a png_size_t variable.
  Added check in png_malloc_default() for (size_t)size != (png_uint_32)size
    which would indicate an overflow.

  Changed sCAL and iCCP failures from png_error to png_warning and abandon.
  Added png_get_uint_31(png_ptr, buf) function.

  Renamed PNG_MAX_UINT to PNG_UINT_31_MAX.
  Made png_zalloc() issue a png_warning and return NULL on potential
    overflow.
  Revised "clobber list" in pnggccrd.c so it will compile under gcc-3.4.
  Revised Borland portion of png_malloc() to return NULL or issue
    png_error() according to setting of PNG_FLAG_MALLOC_NULL_MEM_OK.
  Added PNG_NO_SEQUENTIAL_READ_SUPPORTED macro to conditionally remove
    sequential read support.
  Added some "#if PNG_WRITE_SUPPORTED" blocks.
  #ifdef'ed out some redundancy in png_malloc_default().
  Use png_malloc instead of png_zalloc to allocate the pallete.
  Rearranged order of processing of color types in png_handle_tRNS().
  Added PNG_ROWBYTES macro to calculate rowbytes without integer overflow.
  Updated makefile.darwin and removed makefile.macosx from scripts directory.
  Imposed default one million column, one-million row limits on the image
    dimensions, and added png_set_user_limits() function and
    PNG_SET_USER_LIMITS_SUPPORTED macro to override them.
  Fixed wrong cast of returns from png_get_user_width|height_max().
  Fixed buffer overflow vulnerability in png_handle_tRNS()
  Fixed integer arithmetic overflow vulnerability in png_read_png().
  Fixed some harmless bugs in png_handle_sBIT, etc, that would cause
    duplicate chunk types to go undetected.
  Changed some "keep the compiler happy" from empty statements to returns,
Revised libpng.txt to remove 1.2.x stuff from the 1.0.x distribution
  Revised makefile.darwin and makefile.solaris.  Removed makefile.macosx.
  Revised pngtest's png_debug_malloc() to use png_malloc() instead of
     png_malloc_default() which is not supposed to be exported.
  Fixed old bug in RGB to Gray transformation.
  Fixed problem with 64-bit compilers by casting arguments to abs()
    to png_int_32.
  Changed "ln -sf" to "ln -f -s" in three makefiles (solaris, sco, so9).
  Changed "HANDLE_CHUNK_*" to "PNG_HANDLE_CHUNK_*" (Cosmin)

  Added code to update the row_info->colortype in png_do_read_filler() (MSB).
  Eliminated use of "abs()" in testing cHRM and gAMA values, to avoid
    trouble with some 64-bit compilers.  Created PNG_OUT_OF_RANGE() macro.
  Revised documentation of png_set_keep_unknown_chunks().
  Check handle_as_unknown status in pngpread.c, as in pngread.c previously.
  Moved  "PNG_HANDLE_CHUNK_*" macros out of PNG_INTERNAL section of png.h
  Added "rim" definitions for CONST4 and CONST6 in pnggccrd.c
  Revised pngtest so memory allocation testing is only done when PNG_DEBUG==1.
