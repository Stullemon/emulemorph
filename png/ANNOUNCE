version 1.2.28 [April 30, 2008]

    unknown chunks.
  Added more information about png_set_keep_unknown_chunks() to the
    documetation.
  Revised documentation about unknown chunk and user chunk handling.
  Issue a png_warning when reading a tRNS chunk with out-of-range samples.
  Added check for NULL ptr in TURBOC version of png_free_default().
  Removed several unnecessary checks for NULL before calling png_free().
  Revised png_set_tRNS() so that calling it twice removes and invalidates
    the previous call.
  Revised pngtest to check for out-of-range tRNS samples.
  Added AC_LIBTOOL_WIN32_DLL to configure.ac
  Added MAINTEINERCLEANFILES variable to Makefile.am
  Avoid changing color_type from GRAY to RGB by
    png_set_expand_gray_1_2_4_to_8().
