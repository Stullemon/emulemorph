-------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Download Microsoft Windows SDK for Windows Server 2008 and .NET Framework version 3.5 here:

2. Start Web Install or Setup.Exe on the ISO image.

3. Decide on install folder.

4. Check 'Windows Headers and Libaries'. This is just enough for compiling MorphXT. If you want to install anything else 
   do it but it is not required. Basically, you will only waste space on your hard drive.

5. Wait a quarter of a century for the installation to finish... Actually, it is pretty fast if you do as we suggest.

6. When the installation is finished go to Start --> All Programs --> Microsoft Windows SDK v6.1 --> Visual Studio Registration
   and start Windows SDK Configuration Tool. Follow the instructions and register the new SDK to Microsoft Visual Studio 2005.

7. Start $Source Dir$\srchybrid\emule80.sln and pick build type you want to compile.

8. Be happy with this new fine MorphXT Release.


NOTE: The provided sources contain all additionally required Microsoft SDK includes and libs so this is just about ready to compile.
